<MdDeveloperMode /> Michael James Angelo

I specialize in front-end development, primarily using React to create dynamic and modular user interfaces. Leveraging React's component-based architecture, I ensure scalability and maintainability in my code. My focus is on crafting intuitive and visually appealing designs while optimizing performance for an enhanced user experience.
